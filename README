NIST provided MATRIX MARKET I/O Routines

NOTE: mmio.c was changed to extension .cpp so the g++ compiler would stop complaining about undefined routines.

Method 6 is the closest to a vectorized version with one vector and one matrix. 
Need to order data row varying the fastest, column the slowest so I can vectorize over rows. Important
for output of result. 

I should also implement a version puresly in C++.

I must check that sol_id after RCM still has exacty 32 nonzeros per row. I do not believe that is true when 
I symmetrize. So there must be an error. Yet any matrix permutation of rows and/or columns should not modify the
number of nonzeros per row.
